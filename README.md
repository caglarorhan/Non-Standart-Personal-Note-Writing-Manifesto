**Non-Standart Personal Note Writing Manifesto**

This manifesto tries to create a personal area which includes only personal notes about any subject and draws a boundary around it.
However, it tries to describes how personal notes are held about a subject. What is "not has to", what is "about to" and what is "not it is as it is"!

The main proposal of this manifesto is to be **``Personal !``**.

I am keeping notes from every source of knowledge i met. These notes look messy, confusing, contradictious in itself, ugly, surreal etc..
 I share my notes public mostly at GitHub.
